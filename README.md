SuperScan Automation Application

Overview

SuperScan is a Windows-compatible application whose purpose is to automate the search for supernova suspects using the TheSkyXâ„¢ Professional astro-imaging platform. 

Each night that SuperScan is run, a fresh set of images is taken of all available galaxies that fit a set of user-stipulated criteria.  Each galactic image is compared against the most recent equivalent image from a prior SuperScan run.  If any new light sources appear within the boundaries of the imaged galaxy, their location is derived and flagged.  Upon completion of a scan, the images that contain flagged suspects are displayed for visual analysis and any follow up work a user might want to prove the source real.

As options, SuperScan supports variable exposure length, autofocus, delayed start, execution of pre-scan and post-scan automation scripts, minimum altitude limit, and filter selection.  Additional constraints on the galaxy selection can be made by modifications to the SuperScan database search query.
